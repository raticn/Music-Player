## Music Player

The music player comes with the following features:

- Song Selection: The application includes a library of three songs that users can choose from to play.
- Play/Pause: Users can easily start or pause the currently playing song with a simple click of a button.
- Song Progress Control: The music player displays a progress bar indicating the current position of the song. Users can click anywhere on the progress bar to skip to a specific part of the song.
- 10-Second Song Rewind and Fast-Forward: Users have the ability to rewind or fast-forward a song by 10 seconds by clicking the corresponding buttons.
- When hovering over a song, additional controls for play/pause and song navigation appear. The rewind and fast-forward arrows that appear when hovering need to be clicked twice to initiate the song skipping.
- Automatic Song Transition: When a song reaches its end, the next song in the playlist will automatically start playing.
